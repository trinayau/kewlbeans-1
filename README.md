## Process
### Initialising
On the first day of receiving the project details, we agreed on a team name (Team Latte) and a concept for our project, which was
We designated project roles and discussed everyone's strength and weaknesses. For example, who was more inclined towards front end or back end work, and who wanted to do more project management and deployment tasks.
We pulled together basic information for a project vision board, such as ideal customer, name of site and the purpose of the site. 
Add-ons were also discussed, including stretch goals.
Discussions included:
- Preparing README prototype and presentation
- Favicon selection
- Low-fidelity wireframe for rapid prototyping

### Adding Features
We initially implemented separation of concerns with different Client and Server folders. This was later amended as we needed the server files to be exposed in the root for Heroku deployment. We made different branches for development on GitHub for each of us and got to work on adding the required features of:
- Posting from web page and storing data in a JSON file
- Call on GIPHY API when posting
